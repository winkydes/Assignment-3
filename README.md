# RESTful-API-for-Event-Manipulation
This is the third assignment for the course CSCI2720 building web applications. In this repository, I have created a RESTful API that is able to perform CRUD operations using GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests. The API have access to the MongoDB server using mongoose and express. This API is designed to manipulate events that are hosted, users can create, delete, update and check out the events in the database. The repo also contains some html form to perform some requests, and let user observe the effects of various requests.

# Technologies used
